	<h1> Story </h1>
	
	<p>
		The team dynamics were different when moving from the full team to working as part of a pair.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Early in the semester I was not very active in group communication. I would catch up on everyone's progress at scrum meetings, then leave them to it. 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Working in a pair was much less stressful. I could afford to be a bit more casual without falling behind the group.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		My teamwork and communication skills have improved over the course of the project. I think there is a necessity to be quite strict to maintain order when working with a large team. Small teams can hold together more naturally.

		I was surprised by the scale of the task of polishing our project applications for release.
		Even after all features had been implemented, there was a lot of work done to fix bugs and improve the user experience.
		<br>
		<br>

		In October we were given the opportunity to meet with John Enlow from TracMap to receive feedback on our project applications. He had many suggestions to improve the security of the web API. I did not develop that part of the project but I can appreciate that there is a level a scrutiny beyond what we had exercised so far.
		<br>
		<br>

		We didnâ€™t plan to release the Visual Testing Suite this year, but I did set myself a target to resolve compatibility issues before handing over the project. It seemed like every device we tested the Visual Testing app on revealed new compatibility issues. 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The idea of finishing Path Mapper for a final release is very intimidating.
		There was some measure of relief in knowing the development of the Visual Testing app will be continued by future students. It is important to me that the end product meets an acceptable standard of polish and robustness. From this, I have learnt to be more accurate when planning the development schedule.

		When developing the Path Mapper application we started without having a clear idea of how the end product would be pieced together. This led to quite a drawn-out process of reforming the navigation and user interface of the app.
		<br>
		<br>

		The Visual Testing app is a more pre-determined. The included tools are mostly proven tests that already exist in paper or software form. This helped make up for a lack of planning on the project.
		<br>
		<br>

		For similar projects in the future, I would like to plan out the structure of the application early on. It is quite easy to mock up the screens of this final product and this would have helped us to solve some of the problems with user experience earlier in the development.
