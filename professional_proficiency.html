	<h2> How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup </h2>
	
	<p>
		Our main method of communication during project was our group Slack channel. I stayed active in the channel across the semester. This chat was used a lot for planning meetings. Development sub-groups would form their own group chats so we didnâ€™t bloat our communication channels.

		When I was working on the front end application for Path Mapper with two other students, we used a separate group chat to planning on our task.
