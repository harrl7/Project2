		I attended all group scrum meetings. Having a set time to meet as a group helped keep the large group cohesive. I also tried to attend all client meetings and schedule meetings to the clients convenience.

		Our main method of communication during project was our group Slack channel. I stayed active in the channel across the semester. This chat was used a lot for planning meetings. Development sub-groups would form their own group chats so we didnâ€™t bloat our communication channels.

		When I was working on the front end application for Path Mapper with two other students, we used a separate group chat to planning on our task.

		The requirements of the Visual Testing Suite had many incremental changes as more tools were requested. This semester I added the Line Bisection and the Directional test tools.
		<br>
		<br>

		A change during the development of Path Mapper was when the structure of the web API was updated. I had to update the model classes and API handler in the app to be compatible with the changes.
