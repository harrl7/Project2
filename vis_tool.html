	<h2> Intro </h2>
	
	<p>
		This application is a suite of tools designed to aid people with impaired vision. The project started as a desktop application for a class practical. Later I made an Android demo early in Project. Then it was moved to a full project with our full project group working on it. This semester I returned this application and further developed it in a pair.
		<br>	
		<br>
	</p>
	
	
	<h2> Linear Navigation </h2>
	
	<p>
		In contrast with Path Mapper, the navigation on this application is very simple and linear. The app launches to the Main Menu, which acts as the central hub. This simplicity made the app easier to design and develop, and more navigable to the user. From the menu, there are two, independent, linear branches of the navigation. The tools, and the results.
		<br>			
		<br>
		
		The tools branch is where the user runs the tools. From the main menu the user continues to the tool list screen. The user then selects a tool to run. After the test has concluded, the results are saved to device storage, and the user is sent back the Main Menu.
		<br>			
		<br>
		
		The other branch of the app’s navigation lets the user view their test results. The main menu leads to the Results List screen. Then the user selects they items the wish to review.
		<br>					
		<br>
		
		The two navigation branches are not interdependent. The tools branch creates files, and the results branch reads files. The link between the two is in the formatting  of the files. They could be even separate applications.
		<br>			
		<br>	
		
		This is very liberating on development. As long as the end result output file is consistent, you’re free to make changes as you see fit. While on Path Mapper, I constantly felt like I was checking for compatibility issues after every slight update.
		<br>			
		<br>	
		
		In future, I want to try to keep Android apps light and streamlined. More stuff sounds appealing but there is also a value to intuitive simplicity. The value of simplicity is intensified on a platform with the limitations of mobile. The less space you have to play with, the more easily things becomes cluttered.
		<br>			
		<br>	
		
		Technical Project, more direction, strict requirements
		Tools already designed. We had to build the casing to house the tools. 
		Data security

	<h2> Public Demo </h2>
	
	<p>
		During the development of this application I attended an event where I was able to demo the app to the public. The event was hosted by the project client from the occupational therapy department at polytech. Attendees included field professionals and students, members of charity organisations, and people with diagnosed vision impairment. This gave us good variety of perspectives. The public demonstration of the app showed us problems with the design that would be less obvious to us.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		I saw this as a good opportunity to test the robustness of the application. We had a number of uninitiated users operating the app. I was happy that the app didn’t crash during the event.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		This also let us see how users responded to the navigation. We learnt that the tools lacked direction and it was difficult for users to tell what to do. Impressions were much more positive on the tools with clear input and feedback, such as the directional test.
		<br>	
		<br>
	</p>
	
	
	<h2> Scalability </h2>
	
	<p>
		For most of the development, we only had access to a single device for the purposes of testing. 
		<br>			
		<br>
		
		Because the application is testing the user's vision, there is a minimum display size requirement. The device’s display must cover a large enough area to properly run the tests. Previous Android projects have targeted phones, which gave us an abundance of devices for testing. Early on we decided this project would target tablet devices. This meant we were not able to use phones to test the app during development. 
		<br>			
		<br>	
		
		We also could not test the app on emulated devices. 
		In the Android emulator, the device storage has a different format to physical devices. The application needs to access device storage to save results. This made our app incompatible with the emulator.
		Also, I like to try and avoid emulated devices. There is a problem with lower performance, but mostly it is because of the control scheme.
		<br>			
		<br>	
		
		Developed on single tablet device
		Emulators use a different file system. Run slower, awkward  to control with m/kb. Didnt test on emulator alot
		Phones too small
		Screen res. Controlls don’t scale
		Filenames cannot contain special chars on some devices
		<br>			
		<br>
	</p>
	
	
	<h2> Smaller Team </h2>
	
	<p>	
		This semester the Visual Testing Suite was developed in a pair. I found this to be much more manageable than the larger team of Path Mapper.
		<br>
		<br>	

		The Visual Testing application was developed after Path Mapper. During the second project, I had the benefit of the team building and development experience I gained during the first. 
		<br>
		<br>	
		
		Working in a smaller, more experienced team reduced the overhead cost of team management. It was easy to get the whole together. We could come to a consensus on development decisions quickly. While working as part of the larger team I struggled to keep track of what other people were doing. But on the Visual Testing project, I always felt up to date on the development.
