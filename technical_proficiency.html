		<h2> What is the overall quality of your code like </h2>

		<h3> Path Mapper </h3>
		<p> 
			I think the overall code quality of Path Mapper suffered as a result of lower team cohesion in a large group, and rushing to make large scale changes to the project. The more complex elements often became littered with redundant artifacts of previous versions, which people were too scared to delete. 
			<br>
			I am most happy with the more self contained elements of the project.

			In the class that handles API calls I tried to reuse code wherever I could. As I was adding handling for each of the API functions, I encapsulated the generic parts that could be shared and reused.
			<br>
			
			HTTPGetJSON retrieves the JSON string from the API and does not perform any proccessing on the text. All API handling requires this, the only difference being the input parameter of the specific API function to be called. <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/PathMapper/blob/master/PathMapper/app/src/main/java/bit/com/pathmapper/API/HttpManager.java#L264" target="_blank"> link </a> <br>
			<br>
			
			I also encapsulated the functionality to deserialise JSON objects. This is let me use the same functionality on API calls that retrieve a single item by id, and calls that retrieve an array of items. <a href="https://github.com/OtagoPolytechnic/PathMapper/blob/master/PathMapper/app/src/main/java/bit/com/pathmapper/API/HttpManager.java#L171" target="_blank"> link </a> <br>

		<h3> Vision Tools </h3>
		<p>	
			Overall I am much happier with the quality of the Vision Tools application. I worked on this project after Path Mapper, and had learned from that early work. And we were less rushed and had a smaller more cohesive team which helped alot too.
			<br>
			
			I still like the general system the app uses to run the tools. I developed it last semester but it helps to keep the code clean by taking shared implementation components out of the tool fragments. The timer loop and writing the results to an output file are two good examples of functionality that is not contained in tool fragment files.

			One thing I like to do is try and categorize the components in the onCreate. It helps me to find things later if everything is ordered.
			<br>

			Mostly the tools follow the structure of: move some Views around, evaluate some condition (usually compare coordinates), then write to a the output file. Thinking about the tools in this way helps me to keep them well organised. For example the directional tool

		<h2> How well did you follow best practices in development </h2>
		
		<p>
			During development we held group scrum meetings three times each week. The nominated scrum master recorded the progress made at each meet.

			<br>

			To test the Pathmapper app we created a user testing feedback form. The form has tasks for the user to complete as well as general user experience questions.
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15q3aQpi7iJXMP4Rq1GaKRUQF4hw-aQjc" target="_blank"> link </a> <br>
			<br>

			After a substantial number of users had provided feedback we read through all the forms and compiled a list of the issues that had been identified
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4oAfWQrOmHiWlRIYVYxSDI5Snc" target="_blank"> link </a> <br>
			<br>	
			<br>


			To make the layouts of my apps scale consistently across devices, I followed practices described in the Android developers guide.
			<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html" target="_blank"> link </a> <br>	
			<br>

			<b> 1. Use wrap_content, match_parent, or the dp unit for layout dimensions </b>
			<br>

			<i> “When defining the android:layout_width and android:layout_height for views in an XML layout file, using "wrap_content", "match_parent" or dpunits guarantees that the view is given an appropriate size on the current device screen.” </i>
			<br>

			<i> “Similarly, you should prefer the sp (scale-independent pixel) to define text sizes. The sp scale factor depends on a user setting and the system scales the size the same as it does for dp.” </i>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<b> 3. Do not use AbsoluteLayout </b>
			<br>
			
			<i> “You should instead use RelativeLayout, which uses relative positioning to lay out its child views. For instance, you can specify that a button widget should appear "to the right of" a text widget.” </i>
			<br>
			
			In all Android applications I develop I mostly use either the LinearLayout or RelativeLayout depending on context.
			<br>
			<br>

			Android best practices recommends testing the app on a variety of devices.
			<br>
			
			<i> “Before publishing your application, you should thoroughly test it in all of the supported screen sizes and densities” </i>
			<br>
			
			This practice was followed during the development of Pathmapper as we tested the app using our personal phones and additional phones provided to us. But early in development on the Visual Testing Suite this practice was neglected. For one it wasn’t immediately apparent that this was a problem. Also I often feel like I am not making the best use of time when I invest in user interface over developing new features or improving robustness. 
			<br>
			
			Later when we began to test on different devices and I realised the app would only function properly on a narrow band of devices. Naturally I want the end product to be open to as wide a market as possible, this encouraged me to improve scalability. We tested the application on 3 separate physical devices, as well as a variety of emulated devices including Android televisions.
			<br>
			<br>

			My implementation of Android best practices is exemplified by the main menu for the Visual Testing Suite.
