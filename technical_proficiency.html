		Path Mapper is a companion app for the Dunedin Botanic Gardens. The concept of the project is a digital advancement of a tourist brochure. With points of interest marked on a map to help guests navigate, and extended information on various items within the garden.
		<br>

		An early prototype of this project used the onboard GPS to detect nearby items, and display information when the user approached a point of interest. This was found to be inconsistent because of the inaccuracy of GPS. Therefore this functionality had been practically abandoned when my team began work on the project.
		As a substitute, it had been suggested that QR codes be used to identify items in the gardens. Negating the impact of inaccurate GPS service, while creating a clear link between the application and the physical items in the gardens.
